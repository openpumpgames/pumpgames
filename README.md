Open-source games for live streaming on pump.fun.

This repository is the overall monorepo that will host multiple projects (apps, SDKs, and shared packages). Everything is built with React and Next.js so it can be deployed easily on Vercel’s free tier. The structure is intentionally simple so anyone can fork, clone, and extend it — including AI coding agents like Claude Code.

## Why Open Source?
- Flexible: fork and customize for any livestream needs
- Transparent: code and logic are public and verifiable
- Community‑driven: streamers and developers build together

## Founder Background (short)
I’m a large‑scale software developer with deep experience in building high‑throughput systems and real‑time products. The goal of this project is to create something useful for many people — practical, reliable, and easy to adapt — while staying open, transparent, and community‑owned.

## Vision and Value Growth Plan (token + community)
This is not financial advice. These are simple community goals to align expectations and work.

- Phase 0 — Bootstrap and Docs
  - Open‑source repo and clear README (this)
  - Simple examples so anyone can run and fork
  - Early community feedback and small giveaways
- Phase 1 — First Games + Stability
  - Release 1–2 polished games (e.g., SuperGames, Lucky Draws)
  - Add basic holder rewards and participation tracking
  - Improve OBS overlay and control panel UX
- Phase 2 — Reach $200k Market Cap Goal
  - If/when community reaches ~$500k MC: allocate budget to pay for dexscreener
  - Maintain active moderation and transparent updates
  - Strengthen docs and onboarding for new devs/streamers
- Phase 3 — Community Scale‑up
  - Create official social profiles (X/Twitter, Telegram/Discord, GitHub org) and clear participation paths
  - Open bounties and grant‑style tasks so more people can build products and features

- Phase 4 — Sustainability
  - Keep an open treasury to cover basic costs (infra, domains, tools)
  - Publish periodic reports on spending and roadmap progress
  - Encourage third‑party forks and extensions (it’s open source!)

Market cap targets are aspirational. They do not promise future returns. The purpose is to guide effort, prioritize work, and grow a healthy open community.

## Funding and Sustainability
- Goal: cover essential costs so the project can evolve steadily
- Sources: community donations, optional fees, grants/sponsorships, bounties
- Process: milestone‑based “waves” of funding with simple public notes
- Policy: no secrets in repo; budgets and spending reported openly

## Community Growth Plan
- Create official profiles and keep them active (announcements, tutorials, updates)
- Publish beginner‑friendly guides for streamers and contributors
- Run periodic live sessions with giveaways and Q&A
- Use bounties and tasks to onboard new builders
- Celebrate forks and showcase community projects

## Tech Stack (planned)
- React 18
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (optional)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- Hosting: Vercel (free tier supported)
